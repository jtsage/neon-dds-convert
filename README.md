# neon-dds-convert

**neon-dds-convert:** DDS conversion to WEBP

This project was bootstrapped by [create-neon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-neon).

This project is specifically for use with [FSG Mod Assistant](https://github.com/FSGModding/FSG_Mod_Assistant), thus the API and options available are very, very limited.

## Building neon-dds-convert

Building neon-dds-convert requires a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

To run the build, run:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This command uses the [@neon-rs/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neon-rs/cli) utility to assemble the binary Node addon from the output of `cargo`.

## neon-dds-convert API

This exports a single function called `convert_dds`, accepting 2 arguments.  The first is an ArrayBuffer of the DDS file contents, the second is the maximum size (in pixels) of the image.  Images smaller than this number will not be resized.  This tool assumes square images.

Return value is a base64 string suitable for direct embed as an `<img src="...">`.  Quality is locked to `75`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm install`

Installs the project, including running `npm run build`.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the Node addon (`index.node`) from source, generating a release build with `cargo --release`.

Additional [`cargo build`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html) arguments may be passed to `npm run build` and similar commands. For example, to enable a [cargo feature](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/features.html):

```
npm run build -- --feature=beetle
```

#### `npm run debug`

Similar to `npm run build` but generates a debug build with `cargo`.

#### `npm run cross`

Similar to `npm run build` but uses [cross-rs](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) to cross-compile for another platform. Use the [`CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html#buildtarget) environment variable to select the build target.

#### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests by calling `cargo test`. You can learn more about [adding tests to your Rust code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html) from the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
